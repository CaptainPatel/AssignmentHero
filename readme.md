# Assignment Hero 🦸‍♂️💻

Welcome to Assignment Hero! This project aims to assist students in writing assignments by dictating them according to their writing speed. 🚀

## Motivation ℹ️

The main goal behind Assignment Hero is to make the assignment writing process easier and more efficient for students. 🦸‍♂️

I know this because I have faced the same issue, and I also have my assignments pending which I need to submit by next week, haha. Now you do not have to worry about looking at the screen again and again and finding out where you were or what you were writing because Assignment Hero is here to protect you 😉.

By providing a tool that dictates the assignment content based on the user's pace, students can focus more on crafting their ideas rather than typing at a fixed speed.

## How to Use 🛠️

### Requirements 📋

To use Assignment Hero, you'll need the following libraries:

- `tkinter` (for the GUI)
- `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech functionality)
- `PyPDF2` (for reading text from PDF files)

### Usage 📝

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.
2. Paste your text into the provided text area or use the "Browse File" button to import a text file or PDF.
3. Adjust the sliders for pitch, speed, words per chunk, and pause duration according to your preferences.
4. Click on the "Read Aloud" button to start the dictation.
5. Use the "Pause" button to pause/resume the dictation as needed.
